# Learning Journal Day 3

So far jQuery has made life easier, as well as all of the ES6 tricks I've picked up. The labs being pair coding with random partners has been nice, it's a good chance to network with people I haven't had a chance to work with in 201. I'm looking forward to building on what we've started to learn over the next couple weeks.
