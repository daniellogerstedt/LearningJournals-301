# Learning Journal Day 5 + Weekend Days

I've spent the last couple days doing random codewars kata to increase my ability to think of inventive ways to solve problems. So far they have been quite a bit of fun even when I've been unable to solve them completely in my attempts at more challenging problems. As far as class work goes I feel I've got a strong hold on everything covered during week one and am excited to move on to week two.
